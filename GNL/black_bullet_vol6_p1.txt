Chapter 3 - Hotaru Kouro
Part 1
Seeing Superintendent Atsurou Hitsuma from the MPD headquarters opening the interrogation room's door to make his tardy arrival, Magata Police Station's Inspector Shigetoku Tadashima saluted despite how exasperated he felt towards his superior.
"How is the current situation?"
Lifting his glasses with a middle finger, Hitsuma asked with a keen expression while the middle-aged and slightly obese Tadashima replied:
"Yeah, please have a look yourself, Superintendent Hitsuma."
On the other side of the one-way mirror, a man roughly in his fifties was being questioned. His face was deeply tanned from sunlight exposure while his hair was half grayed. Due to his face looking a bit swollen, his eyes seem to be sunken.
A person's character and experiences tend to show on the face. This was a rule of experience that Tadashima had gathered from his long years as a detective. Based on this intuition, this guy was probably a crafty customer.
"Who is he?"
"Yuuki Iwama, fifty-six years old, taxi driver. According to witnesses, he had allegedly picked up Rentaro Satomi and Hotaru Kouro as passengers, hence we are questioning him. However, he firmly denies transporting anyone similar to those two."
"Isn't there a recording device on the taxi that keeps track of where it has been driven?"
"Yes, but the taxi company he's working for advertises itself as having the cheapest fares in the Tokyo Area, so they cut costs in many areas."
"What is your gut feeling, Inspector Tadashima?"
"This guy is probably fishy."
Hitsuma crossed his arms in front of his chest.
"In that case, can't we force him to spill it?"
"He's just a person of interest! Besides, have you even seen the scene at the apartment,
Superintendent?"
"Yes, a quick glance. Tragic indeed."
Hitsuma deliberately shook his head with a pained expression but seemed rather pretentious in tone of voice. There was a decisive lack of what one could call the soul of language.
